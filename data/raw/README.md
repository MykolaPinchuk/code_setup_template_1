# Raw data provenance log (git-tracked; raw files git-ignored)

Record how you obtained each dataset so runs are reproducible without committing the data itself.

For each dataset, capture:
- source (URL / Kaggle competition name)
- download date
- files placed under `data/raw/<dataset-name>/`
- any filters applied
- checksums (optional)
