# Processed data notes (git-tracked; processed files git-ignored)

This folder is for local, derived artifacts (splits, encoders, cached features) that should not be committed.

If you create any important processed artifacts, record:
- what produced them (command + config path),
- which raw dataset version they correspond to,
- and how to regenerate.
