# REPO_MAP

Keep this file short. Update it only when something important changes.

## Critical entrypoints (read these first for work)
- `agents.md` — general instructions (generated by `context-manager-1`).
- `repo_workflow.md` — repo-specific workflow (triggers + procedures).
- `onboarding.md` — onboarding procedure when triggered.
- `HANDOFF.md` — current objective, next steps, and state.
- `REPO_MAP.md` — index of important files and hot paths.
- `README.md` — repo overview and agent start points.
- `agent_logs/current.md` — live execution log for this cycle.
- `docs/adr/0001-agentic-workflow-protocol.md` — foundational workflow decision.
- `.codex/skills/onboard/SKILL.md` — deterministic onboarding skill definition.
- `.codex/skills/wrap-up/SKILL.md` — wrap-up + handoff skill definition.

## Where results live
- `agent_logs/` — per-cycle logs and index.
- `docs/adr/` — decision records.

## Hot paths (last 1–2 cycles)
- (path) — (why it's being touched)

## New important files since last cycle
- (path) — (purpose)

## Notes
- If you create a new "important" dir or entrypoint, add it above so future agents find it quickly.
