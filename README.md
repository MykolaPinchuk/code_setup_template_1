# codex_setup_template

This repository is a starter template for an agentic workflow (Codex agents under human supervision) designed to work with `context-manager-1`.

## How to use this template
1) Copy these files into your new repo.
2) Run `context-manager-1` sync to generate `agents.md` and `business_context.md`.
3) Start an agent session by attaching `agents.md`.

## For agents
Start here (in this order):
- `agents.md` (generated by `context-manager-1`; general instructions)
- `repo_workflow.md` (repo-specific workflow: triggers + procedures)
- `onboarding.md` (how onboarding works here)
- `HANDOFF.md` (current state / next steps)
- `REPO_MAP.md` (index of important files)
- `agent_logs/current.md` (live execution log; history indexed in `agent_logs/INDEX.md`)
- `docs/adr/` (decisions that should persist across agent generations)

## Context manager integration
- Configure this repo via `.context-profile.yml` (includes the `codex-workflow` instruction profile).
- Sync (generates `agents.md` / `business_context.md`): `python /path/to/context-manager-1/sync_context.py --repo /path/to/this/repo`
- Optional repo-specific additions to `agents.md` can go in `local_context_enrichments/local_agents.md`.

## For humans

### Onboarding
- Start a new Codex chat
- Attach `agents.md`
- Send message: `Onboard`

### Wrap-up / handoff
- Send a message containing `handoff` (or `wrap up`).
- The agent will update `HANDOFF.md`, rotate logs under `agent_logs/`, and (if the repo is a git repo) create a safe handoff commit.

## Repo conventions (high level)
- Keep secrets and large generated artifacts out of git (update `.gitignore` as needed).
- Keep `HANDOFF.md` accurate; do not rely on chat history for continuity.
- Keep `REPO_MAP.md` short; only update it when entrypoints/structure change.

## Customize for your project
- Replace the top of this README with your project overview and quickstart.
- Update `HANDOFF.md` "Current slice" to the next concrete objective.
- Add/ignore any project-specific artifact directories in `.gitignore`.
